## Clone
If you want to clone a repository on Github, and having it on your device, you can navigate any repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/), and you will find a `clone` button which gives a url that you can use to download the repo. 
- take that url and open up `terminal`
- `cd` to the folder you want to place the cloned repo in
- type `git clone PASTE_THE_URL_HERE`
